# SOS: Student Organizer Software (Productivity Planner)

Description:
The Student Organizer Software also known as SOS is a program that shows the current weekly schedule of deadlines and showcases an order of what task to prioritize first. Unlike any typical to-do list organizers, this software is unique in a way that it includes an algorithm that will help the student know and gather their thoughts as to what task should be completed first. This is accomplished by using Eisenhower's Urgent/Important principle wherein the prioritization of tasks will be determined by a certain criteria. This principle is a time management strategy that divides tasks on certain quadrants if they are the following:a. Urgent and Important, b. Not urgent but important, c. urgent and not important, d. not urgent and not important, to be able to distinguish which tasks are needed to be focused on to ensure optimal productivity (Indeed, 2022). Additionally, another unique feature of this program is that it considers the difficulty level of a certain task. The program is catered especially towards students who receive a hefty amount of workload each week and are too overwhelmed on what task to start first. 

Features:
- A menu to choose if what action they want to do
- Feature asking what is their tasks
- A productivity list ordered on what task to prioritize
- A weekly calendar indicating the deadlines of the tasks
